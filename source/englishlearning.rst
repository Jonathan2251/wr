====================

Principle
----------

Immerse in English as long and deep as you can. Which meaning speaking, thinking, listening and reading in English. 
When thinking, speaking and writing in English, your brain will go into the active mode while reading and listening, your brain is stayed in passive mode.

Reading or writing in text improve speaking ability less.

Methods
-------

Speaking with your partner is the best effective way. Develop thinking in English is the next. Don't worry about speaking in wrong ways (wrong pronunciation or wrong sentence), through speaking after video/audio and read more, you will correct yourself. The wrong way won't stay with you too long, and the error won't become your habits.

- First thing is speak up. Find a partner and speak with him even he is Chinese and English is not good. (Do worry the pronunciation and speaking, we have been learning in much time from other accurate material such as video and audio. As the result, the partner's bad speaking cannot affect me.)

- Learning pronunciation first. If you pronunce it in wrong way, then every effort is ineffective. You get nothing in speaking about this word.

- Apply grammar on my sentence when I speak or think in English at intermediate level. At beginning level, it's not easy to have all your sentances fitting the grammar, but it's important for grammar check. After all, I learn English by myself and I have to correct my sentances with grammar.

- Listen slow english and speak after them can improve speaking ability. When the video has no subtitle, and I doubt for some sentences. For example, "She sits at her table." I doubt the "at", and I confirm the sentence by typing it at web search and check if it is a correct sentence.

- Try to think in English as long as you can. And using the simple words as much as I can. Thinking in target language is not natural. Develop the habit of thinking in my target language.

- Remember! "Thinking" is not equal to "speaking". A distance between them, but when I speak more, the distance become short. So, think and speak them as possible as I can.

- Create the same sentence for "people's chinese sentence" rather than translate this sentence word by word. In other word, translate the whole sentence.

- Don't be afraid learning the wrong way in pronuncation or grammar. You can correct it and keep the right answer in memory longer when finding the correct way.

- Spoken English uses much less vocabulary than written english.


Points
-------

In order to immerse in English, I have to find ways to keep myself in fun with English. Otherwise, I cannot immerse in. 
I am a human, not machine, so there is no one-size-fit-all solution for me.

- Over 10 years ago, I was learning English through watching DVD. Watch it several times by turn on Chinese subtitle, turn off subtitle and turn on English subtitle. This was the best way for me at that time.

- Now, speak with a partner, watch "Airstudio English classroom" and "Let's talk in English", think in English and describe what I see in English are the best ways. Leave some time to speak with yourself, don't be too busy in listening.

- Immersing in English by reading books loudly is a good way too. But it takes some time to enter into the story.


Other methods
--------------

- Learn from copy the simple and straight sentence, and use it again and agian. ...

- Find and create more value or motivation for English learning.

  In instance:
  
  I sent my son to learn English after school and ask him to speak English to 
  me when he want me playing a game with him.
  
  I work in an American company of Taiwan branch now. And imagining 
  that I will work in American office for two or three years one day. Actually,
  it is possible if my English is fluent.
  
- Use English-English dictionary and read the dictionary's sentence loudly.

  For example:
  
  Heritage and inheritance both can be translated into 遺產 (yi chan: Chinese 
  pin yin). 
  But it's different in English.
  
  Heritage can refer to:
  
  the art, building, traditions, and beliefs that a society considers important 
  to its history and culture.
  
  For instance:
  
  Ireland's rich musical heritage.
  
  Inheritance can refer to:
  
  property or money that you receive from someone when they die.
  
  For instance:
  
  He received a large inheritance.
  
  
  The extent and level can be translated into 程度 (cheng du: Chinese pin yin).
  But it's different in English.
  
  Extent can refer to:
  
  the importance of a problem or situation.
  
  For instance: 
  
  Doctors still do not know the full extent of his injuries.
  
  Level can refer to:
  
  the standard of someone ability.
  
  For instance: 

  These students have not reached an advanced level yet.
  
  Unfortunately, it's not suited for children since their vocabulary is not much. 

- Exchange spare room for teaching English

- English is divided by written english and spoken english. When learning english from DVD or mp3, find alternative words by google.

  Language learning business
  ---------------------------
  
  - Creating a language cafe like http://g1132269.pixnet.net/blog/post/179254411-%e9%9f%93%e5%9c%8b%e6%89%93%e5%b7%a5%e6%8f%9b%e5%ae%bf%e7%ac%ac%e4%b8%80%e5%a4%a9-%e5%a5%87%e7%89%b9%e5%b7%a5%e4%bd%9c%e7%9a%84%e9%96%8b%e5%a7%8b
    
    - Adults don't like to spend money for learning English.
    
    - English is needed for young workers and both men and women want to make friends with others.
  
  - Create an English search engine as follows,

    - Functions:

      - Grammar search: ex. get <V> or <Adj>

      - Translation: Chinese from/to English (existed feature in chinese-english electronic dictionary)
  
    - Correct typing error for each word just like the yahoo and google search engine.
  
      - This feature can be implemented by search dictionary or hire open source code with this feature.


  - Create a IT office which speaking English only.
  
  - Create a language learning website provides the following service:
    
    1. Wire money service about payment through this website. Users can wire money one time and pay for services of multi-transactions. Promise paid customers can get their services after payment.
    
    2. Free for posting skype account, available time, language exchange or practice language with others.
    
    3. Homestay for foreigners:
    
       Inlcude charge money, charge for service providing, charge for language teaching, or free.
       
    4. Language teaching for payment.
    
    5. Language learning and make money:
    
       For example, writing a book with English and Chinese language. People can find co-works for English speaker and Chinese speaker, working together and earn money from this work.
    
    6. Get money from ad. of English cram school, related language learning business, or hotel listing download.
    
    7. Provide voice chat through this website if we can implement the better voice-over-ip service through software.
    
       Maybe it's impossible since the facebook talking is not better than Skype as my experience.

Translation
------------

常見的翻譯錯誤(英文）

In spite of no one-to-one corresponding relation in English-Chinese, every one learn 
his Target second language by translation more or less. I learn my spoken English 
through chatting with my Taiwanese partner, so of course I do translation too.
But for spoken English, I need to come out the simple Chinese sentence and translate
it into English form time to time to express what I want to say. Otherwise, I cannot 
finish it because it will take too much time and difficult to translate it if I come
out not simple Chinese first.
Write down the common not good sentences I know and **the simple way to translate into
spoken English** as follows,

- 我 ``只是想知道`` 你的英文 ``程度``

  - I ``wonder`` ``how good`` your English is.

  - I ``just want to know`` your English ``level``.
  
- 對他開玩笑, 捉弄他

  - play on him. (v)
  
  - play for him. (x)
  
- 這電話聲音斷斷續續的

  - The phone sounds on and off(, on and off).
  
- 這雨斷斷續續的

  - The rain is on and off.
  
- 上坡 uphill, 下坡 downhill

  - 這路 ``全`` 是上坡 The road is uphill ``all the way``.
  
  - (這路是上坡, )讓我們走上坡 Let's walk up.

- She fianted when I told her the news.

  - Chinese usually uses "after" intead of "when". Notice it when do translation.


Other ideas
-------------

.. 
  Set up a place to take care Philipines English speaking children and charge 
  for those who want to learn English in Taiwan (include children and adult).
  If revenue is good, then pay money to those Philipines children.


  Can I adopt a Philippine child? Is it legal in Taiwan?
  I am a Christian and spent $3,000 US dollars in my child after school education 
  for English learning last year.
  I heard that Philippine child speak English, and think why not save the money 
  to raise a Philippine child.
  He can bring my child's English learning in more nature way. 
  On the other hand, my child can bring him Chinese in nature way too.
  And this $3,000 US dollars can provide the Philippine child
  in food and expense.


  Pay money to Philippine children to learn English with him through Skype.
  By wire money. It's cheaper and good to both me and him.


My Writing
-----------

Slow down is good for learning
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Today I watched a video of english learning from YouTube. It introduced about how to learn English.
Just like the name of web site, www.sloweasyenglish.com which the speakers told people from learning slow easy English pace 
rather than learning from fast speed. The point is to learn English from slow pace and easy vacabulary and spend time to 
practice English. In contrast, many people, include me, fall in the trap in learning with quick pace and try to learn too 
much words without thinking, and evently, we cannot aborb what we learn. We drop in the vicious circle: "The more we learnt and the more we
forgot" and "The more we learnt and the less and slow we can speak".

The reading and listening are inputs while writing and speaking are outputs. Only through practice with our outputs, we
can master our English. Otherwise, we will be the slave of English.
